## About
Developed for CPSC470 Senior Project

This game is built around an interactable 3x3 Rubik's Cube. Includes a solver algorithm that implements the Beginner's Method and provides detailed and interactable instructions for solving the cube in any state using an Iterative-Deepening A* Search Algorithm

## Results
The Rubik's Cube solver was tested on 1,000 scrambles of 25 moves each. On average the solver can compute a solver in 3.64 seconds using about 109 moves.
